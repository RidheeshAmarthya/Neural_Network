# Neural_Network
Creating a neural network from scartch in python (Soon in C++)

All the main code is in the main.py file, NNS file as addition implementation from NNSFS series (fabric classification).

Unzip the data set for the main function, as for the needed dataset for NNS either contact me or find fashion_mnist_images, should be not too hard
